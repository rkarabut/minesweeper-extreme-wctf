# Minesweeper EXTREME

Minesweeper EXTREME was a CTF challenge prepared for the WCTF 2020 online event. This repository contains the original challenge as it was shared with the teams, the source code (which was also provided to the teams in the second half of the competition) and the reference solution. 

The video of the talk is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/2s-F-oACy4E).

The code was forked from Robert Mikhayelyan's [minesweeper-rs](https://github.com/robmikh/minesweeper-rs) (thank you!)
